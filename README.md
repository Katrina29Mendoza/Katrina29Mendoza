## Hi there ðŸ‘‹

Welcome to my GitHub repository! Iâ€™m an embedded systems developer focused on programming microcontrollers using C to build efficient, low-level solutions for hardware-driven applications. This repository is a collection of my projects, experiments, and learning resources as I work on real-time systems, device interfacing, and firmware development.

My work revolves around writing optimized, reliable C code that runs close to the hardware. I enjoy working with bare-metal systems as well as real-time operating systems (RTOS), focusing on things like memory management, peripheral configuration, interrupt handling, and low-power design. Whether it's blinking an LED, setting up communication protocols like I2C, SPI, and UART, or working on more complex tasks like sensor fusion or data logging, Iâ€™m constantly learning and refining my skills.

The projects here cover a variety of microcontrollersâ€”ranging from popular platforms like STM32 and AVR to more constrained 8-bit devices. Iâ€™m also exploring build systems, linker scripts, and debugging tools like JTAG and SWD to better understand the full embedded development lifecycle.

This repository is meant to serve as both a personal learning archive and a resource for others who are getting into embedded programming. If youâ€™re interested in low-level development, working with microcontrollers, or just want to see how C is used in real-world hardware projects, feel free to explore, clone, or contribute.

Thanks for visiting! I hope this space helps you find useful code, sparks a new idea, or encourages you to dive deeper into the world of embedded systems.
